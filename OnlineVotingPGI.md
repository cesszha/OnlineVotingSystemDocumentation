# Project General Information

Group Name: TRIO
Project Title: Online Voting System

## A. Problem Statement

1. Security and Integrity

The primary concern with online voting systems is ensuring the security and integrity of the voting process. Current systems may be susceptible to cyberattacks, including hacking, phishing, and malware, which could compromise voter data and alter election outcomes. Additionally, the lack of robust encryption and secure authentication methods raises concerns about unauthorized access and voter impersonation. If these security vulnerabilities are not addressed, the trust in the electoral process may diminish, leading to decreased voter participation and questions regarding the legitimacy of election results

2. Voter Verification and Privacy

Another significant issue is the challenge of providing voters with a means to verify their votes while maintaining the privacy of their choices. Many online voting systems lack a reliable method for voters to confirm that their votes have been accurately recorded and counted without revealing their identity or choice. Without a verifiable process, voters may feel insecure about the confidentiality of their votes, which can deter participation and undermine the overall credibility of the electoral system.

3. Usability and Accessibility

The usability and accessibility of online voting systems are critical for ensuring that all eligible voters can participate in elections. Many existing systems may be overly complex or not designed with inclusivity in mind, potentially alienating certain voter demographics, including the elderly, disabled, or those with limited technological proficiency. If the online voting system is not user-friendly and accessible, it could lead to disenfranchisement of certain groups, resulting in skewed election outcomes and a lack of representation in the democratic process.

## B. Project Description

The Online Voting System aims to streamline the electoral process enhance voter accessibility, and ensure the accuracy and integrity of election results. By enabling secure, accessible, and transparent voting through an online platform. This system is designed to enhance voter participation, reduce the costs associated with traditional voting methods, and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. With the growing need for secure and efficient voting mechanisms, this system will leverage modern technology to facilitate online voting, minimizing the logistical challenges of traditional voting methods.

The Online Voting System represents a significant advancement in how democratic processes, promoting greater voter engagement and participation that can be conducted in the digital age. By ensuring security, accessibility, and transparency, aims to foster greater participation in elections, strengthen the democratic process, and civic engagement and restore trust in electoral integrity. The system also strives to build confidence in democratic processes while ensuring that every vote counts. Through careful planning, development, and stakeholder engagement, this project can revolutionize the voting experience for millions of citizens. As technology continues to evolve, this system positions itself as an essential modern tool for future elections.

## C. Project Objectives

To develop an online voting system to streamline various types of voting, e.g. Non-profit organization voting, surveys or polls, etc. with the following features:

**1. Anonymize votes**: the user can be anonymous when voting, preserving their privacy.
**2. User authentication**: the user can create an account to see their voting history.
**3. Ballot Designing**: The voters can get the basic information and background of the candidate. They’ll be able to see the
credibility of the candidate, prompting them to make an informed decision.
**4. Mobile compatibility**: voters are able to access the voting form using a mobile device. Not only is this feature convenient, but some voters don't have access to it on their desktops or laptops
**5. User-friendly interface**: simple is better than complex. A minimal interface is more appealing than having a ton of UI elements.
**6. Confidentiality and Integrity**: online voting system faces critical challenges in ensuring confidentiality to protect voter identities and choices from unauthorized access, as well as integrity to guarantee that votes are accurately cast, counted, and reported without tampering, thereby maintaining public trust in the democratic process.

## D. Business Benefits

**1. Increase participation and engagement**: As the voting process can be done online, it will maximize the voters who can vote on the poll or voting.
**2. Cost efficiency**: The cost efficiency will be noticeable, lesser printing and postage.
**3. Speed and convenience**: Since the voting are held online the process is seamless and hassle-free, leveraging the fast internet in modern times.
**4.Global Reach**: Online voting systems provide a platform that can easily accommodate various language needs, time zones, and regulatory constraints, which is beneficial for organizations that operate in numerous countries as it facilitates the gathering of input from a diverse global workforce.
